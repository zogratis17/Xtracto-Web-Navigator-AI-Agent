# Web-Navigator-AI-Agent

## Problem Statement Chosen : Web Navigator AI Agent

## Required Solution

Build an AI Agent that can take natural language instructions and autonomously drive the web on a local computer.The system should combine a locally running LLM (for understanding and planning) with a browser automation setup such as Chrome Headless or a browser inside a local VM. Users should be able to give simple commands (e.g., “search for laptops under 50k and list top 5”) and the agent should execute them by controlling the browser, extracting results, and returning structured outputs. Optional features include multi-step reasoning, error handling, task memory, and basic GUI for interaction.
