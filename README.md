# Web-Navigator-AI-Agent

## Problem Statement Chosen : Web Navigator AI Agent

## Required Solution

Build an AI Agent that can take natural language instructions and autonomously drive the web on a local computer.The system should combine a locally running LLM (for understanding and planning) with a browser automation setup such as Chrome Headless or a browser inside a local VM. Users should be able to give simple commands (e.g., “search for laptops under 50k and list top 5”) and the agent should execute them by controlling the browser, extracting results, and returning structured outputs. Optional features include multi-step reasoning, error handling, task memory, and basic GUI for interaction.

## Reason to Choose the Statement:

The increasing complexity of web-based tasks and the need for automation in everyday browsing make an AI-powered web navigator highly relevant. By enabling users to interact with the web using natural language, this solution bridges the gap between human intent and digital execution, improving productivity and accessibility. The project leverages cutting-edge AI and browser automation technologies, aligning with current trends in local AI deployment and privacy. It also offers significant value for developers, businesses, and individuals seeking efficient, autonomous web interactions without relying on cloud-based solutions.
