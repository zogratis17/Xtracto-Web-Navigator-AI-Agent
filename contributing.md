## âš¡ How We Worked  

### Planning & Vision  
- Conducted brainstorming sessions to define problem statement & scope.  
- Designed modular architecture separating **LLM**, **backend orchestration**, and **browser extension**.  
- Broke down tasks with ownership and timelines.  

### Collaboration & Workflow  
- Used **GitHub projects** + feature branches for parallel development.  
- Weekly sync-ups to align progress and resolve blockers.  
- Shared diagrams, architecture drafts, and mockups in GitHub Discussions.  
- Followed **PR-based workflow** with code reviews for every feature.  

### Development  
- **Backend:** APIs, automation, RAG integration, error handling.  
- **Frontend/Extension:** UI toggles, chat threads, DB integration.  
- **LLM Integration:** Prompt strategies, structured outputs, reasoning optimizations.  
- **Systems Setup:** Dockerized services, local DB + FAISS memory integration.  

### Testing & Review  
- Unit tests for backend API reliability.  
- Manual + automated tests for browser actions.  
- UI testing for extension interactivity and responsiveness.  
- Peer code reviews before merges to main branch.  

### Documentation & Presentation  
- Maintained **README.md** for workflow, setup, and demo usage.  
- Created **CONTRIBUTING.md** (this file) to explain team workflow.  
- Added diagrams, sequence flows, and RAG pipeline documentation.  
- Prepared demo materials for hackathon showcase.

## ðŸ’¡ What Made Our Workflow Unique  

1. **Offline-first LLM + Web Automation** â†’ Works even with minimal connectivity.  
2. **Lightweight Extension Bridge** â†’ Direct toggle control + local DB storage.  
3. **Iterative RAG Integration** â†’ FAISS-powered context retrieval for smarter browsing.  
4. **Dockerized Environment** â†’ Quick replication across dev machines.  
5. **Innovation-First Research Role** â†’ A dedicated member (Vellayudham) focused on exploring cutting-edge ideas while others built the core.

## âœ… Summary  

Our team followed a **modular, collaborative, and innovation-driven approach** to deliver a functional **Web Navigator AI Agent**.  
By clearly dividing responsibilities, maintaining strong communication, and prioritizing reliability, we built a system that bridges **LLMs, browser automation, and user interfaces** in a unique way.  

This approach not only ensured project success but also laid the groundwork for future extensions like **multi-agent orchestration, cloud sync, and advanced RAG pipelines**.
